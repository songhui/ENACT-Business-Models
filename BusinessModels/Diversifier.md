# DivEnact (Diversity enactor of IoT fleet) - Business Model

This page contains the business model for the Diversifier tool. The ENACT Diversifier automatically generates, for a smart IoT system, the alternative components with different message protocols, and the alternative global deployments with different stacks, libraries and configurations.

    <td rowspan="1">
      <p>
        Needs agile and continous deployment and maintenance of software applications on a large fleet of IoT device sets. Needs to diversify the software application among the fleet according to the different contexts of the individual devices.

      <b>Existing Alternatives</b> </td>

      <p>
        
Current solutions: Current solutions: (i) Existing deployment tools such as Ansible and GeneSIS on targeting at single IoT device sets, but not a large number of similar device sets (IoT fleet). (ii) Fleet management tools or platforms, such as Azure IoT Hub, Balena, etc., requires manual assigment of software variants into devices. (iii) Orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, automatically assign software components to physical nodes within a cluster, but ignores the differences between nodes.
